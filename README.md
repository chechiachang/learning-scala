# Learning-scala

This is my practicing project to learning scala. Feel free to browse and you'll find nothing more than some rookie pragram and notes lol. 

### Functional Programming Principles in Scala
Course on Coursea by Prof. Martin Odersky 
[Course link](https://www.coursera.org/learn/progfun1/home)

It's a basic (but very inspiring) lectures taught by the father of scala.

All lecture contents belong to Coursera and the authors. Other than lectures, there are some notes and homework written by myself.

### Playground

Under the playground package, are my practicing questions and solutions. 

The main source od the questions (and most answers) came from the internet. I have no ability to create anyone of them (yet!?).

### Programming in Scala

In this directory contains my learning notes reading a book with the same title, 
[Programming in Scala, 3rd ed.](https://www.scala-lang.org/documentation/books.html)

This book is recommended by the [scala-lang.org](https://www.scala-lang.org/) and its marvelous. Strongly recommended.
