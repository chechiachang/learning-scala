# learning-scala

This is my practicing project to learning scala. Feel free to browse and you'll find nothing more than some rookie pragram and notes lol.

### Course on Coursea by Prof. Martin Odersky

It's a basic (but very inspiring) lectures taught by the father of scala.
[Course link](https://www.coursera.org/learn/progfun1/home)

All lecture contents belong to Coursera and the authors. Other than lectures, there are some notes and homework written by myself.

### Playground

Under the playground package, are my practicing questions and solutions. The main source od the questions (and most answers) came from the internet. I have no ability to create anyone of them (yet!?).

### Programming in Scala

In this directory contains my learning notes reading a book with the same title, 
Programming in Scala, 3rd ed.
This book is recommended by the [scala-lang.org](https://www.scala-lang.org/documentation/books.html) and its marvelous. Strongly recommended.
